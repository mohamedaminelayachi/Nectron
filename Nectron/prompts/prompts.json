  "srs": "A Sequential Reasoning Strategy (SRS) is a way to reason about the program, represented as enumerated steps expressed in natural language that explain how to implement the program.\n\nTo exemplify this, the following is a sequential reasoning strategy for a program that returns a maximum of two numbers.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes two parameters, 'num1' and 'num2'.\n2) If 'num1' is greater than 'num2', return 'num1' as the maximum.\n3) If 'num2' is greater than 'num1', return 'num2' as the maximum.\n4) If 'num1' is equal to 'num2', return either one since they are the same.\n</srs>\n\nAnother example of this would be an SRS program that returns the sum of two integers.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes two integers, 'num1' and 'num2', as parameters.\n2) Add 'num1' and 'num2' together and store the result in a variable called 'sum_'.\n3) Return the sum of 'num1' and 'num2' that's stored in the variable 'sum_'.\n</srs>\n\nSequential Reasoning Strategies can also describe programs that tackle mathematical concepts like integrals. Consider a program that solves the integral of x^2 from a to b. Then, the corresponding SRS would be as follows.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes three integers 'x', 'a', and 'b' as input.\n2) Calculate the integral of x^2 from 'a' to 'b' using the formula: integral_value = (b^3 - a^3) / 3.\n3) Return the calculated integral value stored in the variable 'integral_value'.\n</srs>\n\nFinally, another example to illustrate is one in which SRS describes an explicit behavior. Consider a program that swaps the values of two pointers to numbers. Then, the corresponding SRS would be as follows:\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes two pointers to numbers, 'num1' and 'num2', as input.\n2) Assign the value of 'num2' to 'num1'.\n3) Assign the value stored in 'num1' to 'num2'.\n4) Return the updated values of 'num1' and 'num2'.\n</srs>\n\nYou MUST know that Sequential Reasoning Strategies are not designed to tackle programs with recursion, loops, or any other form of iteration. However, one trick you can use to avoid this limitation, when appropriate of course, is to only consider what's happening inside the loop or recursion, especially if the loop or recursion is not complex.\n\nFor instance, consider an SRS for a program that computes the infinite series of 1/2^n for all n integers, which doesn't respect the rule because it includes a form of iteration that is a loop.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes a maximum value, 'max_value'.\n2) Initialize 'res' to 0.\n3) Use a loop to iterate over 'n' from 0 to a predefined maximum value or until the change in 'res' becomes negligible. Inside the loop, calculate '1/2^n' and add it to the 'res'.\n4) Return 'res'.\n</srs>\n\nTo fix this, you can simply only consider what's happening inside the loop and write it as follows.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes a maximum value, 'max_value'.\n2) Initialize 'res' to 0.\n3) Inside the loop, calculate '1/2^n' and add it to the 'res'.\n4) Return 'res'.\n</srs>\n\nThis means that we don't care about how the loop iterates, we simply want to know if there's a variable is changed, specifically variables that are declared inside the program locally but not inside the loop.\n\nThe following are rules that MUST be respected:\n\n- All variables that might be included in the strategy should be written inside single quotes, like this 'VAR_NAME'\n- Don't include function name, just write \"function\", \"procedure\", or anything appropriate instead.\n- Don't write any code, just write in natural language expression.\n- Please note that, sometimes, we use the words program, function, and procedure interchangeably.\n- If there's step that has multiple sub-steps, try to separate them.\n- Focus on the ultimate behavior of the program and not necessarily how to implement it.\n\n\nGiven all the knowledge written above, generate a Sequential Reasoning Strategy for the following program's description:\n\n\"\"\"\nPROGRAM_DESCRIPTION\n\"\"\"\n\nTo ensure you follow a correct reasoning, it is best that you also provide an explanation for the generated strategy.

  "syntax_correction": "You are a helpful AI assistant dedicated to helping users correct the syntax and semantics of NAR representations to the best of your ability. NAR stands for Nectron Abstract Representation, a formal language developed as an intermediate step to generate verification contracts in formal methods' frameworks. Programs written in NAR have a higher abstraction, and they are more formal overall. Leverage your reasoning capabilities to correct any occurring syntax or semantic errors in a given NAR representation.\n\nA NAR representation MUST have three sections: 'var', 'action', and 'return', in this exact order.\n\nFirst, the program begins with a 'var' section, it is where all the variables of the sequential reasoning strategy are declared. NAR allows only two types: 'integer' and 'pointer'. To declare the variables, you MUST ensure that the 'var' section is also declared, and to do so you just have to write 'var:' then you start declaring the variables in NAR's syntax, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\nvar:\n    x, y: pointer\n\"\"\"\n\nIn the example above, we have declared two pointer variables named 'x' and 'y'. Which is equivalent to writing:\n\n\"\"\"\nvar:\n    x: pointer\n    y: pointer\n\"\"\"\n\nYou should know that integers and pointers are handled the same in NAR, they just have different meanings in the compilation process. Therefore, dereferencing and arrow operators are not allowed in NAR.\n\nSecondly, a NAR representation MUST have one 'action' section, it is where all actions of the sequential reasoning strategy are performed under certain conditions. An action is expressed as follows:\n\n<assignment> condition <condition | ANY>\n\n- The <assignment> encapsulates an assignment operation between a variable and an expression, which could be another variable, mathematical expression, function, or bitwise operation.\n- The keyword 'condition' signifies that this particular assignment is performed under a certain condition.\n- The <condition | ANY> is where the condition holds place, it indicates that this assignment should pass this condition for it to be performed. If the condition is explicitly stated or your reasoning capabilities have determined one, write it between parenthesis as follows:\n\n\"\"\"\ncondition (x == 0)\n\"\"\"\n\nHowever, if the assignment is performed in any case, then you MUST use the keyword 'ANY', as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\ncondition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nTo write an action, you MUST ensure that the 'action' section is also declared, and to do so you just have to write 'action:' then you start writing the actions in NAR's syntax, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\naction:\n    x = y + 1 condition (y > x)\n    y = x condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nIn the example above, we have performed two actions. In the first action, we have set 'x' to 'y+1' when 'y' is strictly greater than 'x'. Whereas, in the second action, we have set 'y' to 'x' under no condition at all, which is why we used the keyword 'ANY'.\n\n- Note that each action is written in a new line.\n- Each action MUST have a condition, either explicit or ANY.\n\nFinally, a NAR representation MUST have one 'return' section, which is where all the outputs of the sequential reasoning strategy are returned under a certain condition. A return is expressed as follows:\n\n<output> condition <condition | ANY>\n\n- The <output> encapsulates an output of sequential reasoning strategy which could be a variable, mathematical expression, boolean (true, false), function, bitwise operation, the 'None' keyword in case there's no return, or the 'POS' or 'NEG' keywords in case there's a broader range of positive, or negative values, respectively.\n- The keyword 'condition' signifies that this particular output is returned under a certain condition.\n- The <condition | ANY> is where the condition holds place, it indicates that this output should pass this condition for it to be returned. If the condition is explicitly stated or your reasoning capabilities have determined one, write it between parentheses. However, if the output is returned in any case, then you MUST use the keyword 'ANY'. Use the examples above to have clear guidance.\n\nTo write a return, you MUST ensure that the 'return' section is also declared, and to do so you just have to write 'return:' then you start writing the actions in NAR's syntax, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\nreturn:\n    x condition (x % 2 == 0)\n    abs(x) condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nIn the example above, we have returned two outputs. In the first return, we have returned the value of 'x' when x is even, or equivalently divisible by 2. Whereas, in the second return, we have returned the absolute value of 'x' under no condition, which is why we have used the keyword 'ANY'.\n\n- Note that each return is written in a new line.\n- Each return MUST have a condition.\n\n\nTo fully understand the NAR format and how you could write a NAR representation, consider the example of a sequential reasoning strategy that presents a methodology - expressed in natural language - for a program that swaps two numbers using pointers.\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes two pointers to numbers, 'num1' and 'num2', as input.\n2) Assign the value of 'num2' to 'num1'.\n3) Assign the value stored in 'num1' to 'num2'.\n4) Return the updated values of 'num1' and 'num2'.\n</srs>\n\nThen, the NAR representation would be:\n\n<nar>\nvar:\n    x, y: pointer\naction:\n    temp = x condition ANY\n    x = y condition ANY\n    y = temp condition ANY\nreturn:\n    None condition ANY\n</nar>\n\nThe strategy doesn't return anything, that's why we have used the keyword 'None'.\n\nNow to correct a NAR representation, you have to leverage all the knowledge you have about how to write it. However, when you correct the NAR representation, you MUST have the incorrect version of it, and that's a role the user should do.\n\n<modular_example>\n\nFor example, consider a sequential reasoning strategy for a program that takes in two integers and only swaps them if they are both positive, such as:\n\n<srs>\n1) Define a function that takes two integer numbers, 'x' and 'y', as input.\n2) If 'x' is positive and 'y' is positive. Then, assign the value of 'y' to 'x'.\n3) If 'x' is positive and 'y' is positive. Then, assign the value stored in 'x' to 'y'.\n4) Return the updated values of 'x' and 'y'.\n</srs>\n\nThe user also gives you the incorrect NAR representation.\n\n<nar>\nvar:\n    x, y: float\naction:\n    x = y + 1 condition ANY\n    y = x condition ANY\nreturn:\n    None condition ANY\n</nar>\n\nThe program above has several problems:\n\n1) The type of the variables in the 'var' section is not correct, because it was stated in the sequential reasoning strategy that the input variables are integers and not real. Also, there's no 'float' data type in NAR. So, the correct variable declaration is \"x, y: integer\".\n2) The first action is incorrect because the sequential reasoning strategy explicitly says that you have to assign the value of 'y' to 'x' not 'y + 1'. As such, the correct assignment is 'x = y'.\n3) Both actions are performed under false conditions, and that's because the sequential reasoning strategy states that the actions are only performed when the two integer variables 'x' and 'y' are both positive and not under ANY condition. Therefore, the correction is \"condition (x >= 0) and (y >= 0)\".\n\nHaving said that, the correct NAR representation is as follows:\n\n<nar>\nvar:\n    x, y: integer\naction:\n    temp = x condition ANY\n    x = y condition (x >= 0) and (y >= 0)\n    y = temp condition (x >= 0) and (y >= 0)\nreturn:\n    None condition ANY\n</nar>\n\n</modular_example>\n\n- Each action MUST contain an assignment and condition.\n- Each return MUST contain a condition, either specified or ANY.\n- Functions can accept mathematical expressions when appropriate, and they can be used in mathematical expressions themselves.\n- The NAR allows only the following mathematical operations: Addition '+', Subtraction '-', Multiplication '*', Division '/', Modulo '%', and Floor Division '//'.\n- The NAR allows only the following bitwise operators: NOT '~', AND '&', OR '|', XOR '^', RIGHT SHIFT '>>', LEFT SHIFT '<<'.\n- Do not use loops or recursions. However, one trick you can use to avoid this limitation, when appropriate of course, is to only consider what's happening (assignments, returns, etc..) inside the loop or recursion, especially if the loop or recursion is not complex.\n- If any form of iteration (Loops or Recursion) is necessary for the program so intrinsically that the NAR representation cannot be corrected and you cannot deduce the states of the input variables after the iteration block. Then, simply write <NON_NAR_PROGRAM>.\n- strings are NOT allowed - NO string variables or text in quotes - in NAR so use ONLY what's given.\n\nWith all this knowledge, please correct the following NAR representation:\n\n<nar>\nINPUT_NAR_PROGRAM\n</nar>\n\nTo guide yourself when correcting the NAR representation above, consider using the following sequential reasoning strategy:\n\n<srs>\nINPUT_SRS\n</srs>\n\nThe corrected NAR MUST be wrapped inside <nar> </nar>, NO other delimiter is allowed.\n\nTo ensure you follow a valid correction reasoning, it is best that you also provide an explanation for your corrections. Simply write:\n\n<explanation>\nWrite the explanation here...\n</explanation>",
  "contracts_refinement": "You are a formal methods expert helping users to verify programs. In this task, you're using ACSL or ANSI/ISO C Specification Language to write contracts for programs.\n\n(ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) is a formal specification language designed to be used with C programs. It provides a way to specify the behavior and properties of C functions and programs using annotations written in comments within the source code. These annotations describe preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and other properties that the program should satisfy.

Leverage your reasoning capabilities to provide concise conversions and ensure its syntactic and semantic correctness.\n\nA Sequential Reasoning Strategy is a methodological way how to reason about a program's behavior, it is used as an informal pseudocode - expressed in natural language - to help you reason about a particular program to form a concise abstract representation in the Nectron Abstract Representation.\n\nThe NAR conversion of a sequential reasoning strategy MUST have three sections: 'var', 'action', and 'return', in this exact order.\n\nFirst, each NAR translation has one 'var' section, it is where all the variables of the sequential reasoning strategy are declared.

An action is expressed as follows:\n\n<assignment> condition <condition | ANY>\n\n- The <assignment> encapsulates an assignment operation between a variable and an expression, which could be another variable, mathematical expression, function, or bitwise operation. For instance \"x = 1 + sin(pi)\".\n- The keyword 'condition' signifies that this particular assignment is performed under a certain condition.\n- The <condition | ANY> is where the condition takes place, it indicates that this assignment should pass this condition for it to be performed. If the condition is explicitly stated or your reasoning capabilities have determined one, write it between parenthesis as follows:\n\n\"\"\"\ncondition (x == 0)\n\"\"\"\n\nHowever, if the assignment is performed in any case, then you MUST use the keyword 'ANY', as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\ncondition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nTo understand how conditions are structured and can be used, consider the next examples:\n\n- If you want to check if 'x' is divisible by 3, then it is equivalent to state that 'x' modulo 3 is equal to zero or in NAR syntax: \"\"\"condition (x % 3 == 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is odd, then it is equivalent to stating that 'x' is divisible by 2, which is also equivalent to stating that 'x' modulo 2 is equal to zero or in NAR syntax: \"\"\"condition (x % 2 == 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is different than 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x != y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is equal to 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x == y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is greater than 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x > y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is greater than or equal to 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x >= y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is less than 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x < y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is less than or equal to 'y', then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x <= y)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is positive (or equal to zero), then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x >= 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is strictly positive, then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x > 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is negative (or equal to zero), then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x <= 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x' is strictly negative, then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x < 0)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if 'x + 1' equals zero, then the NAR conversion would be: \"\"\"condition (x+1 == 0)\"\"\"\n\nNote that sometimes you will be told to check if an expression is bigger or smaller than another expression, it is equivalent to checking if the first expression is greater than or smaller than the second expression, respectively.\n\nThe Nectron Abstract Representation also allows the comparison between variables and booleans:\n\n- If you want to check if 'x' is true, you can use the 'is' keyword in NAR to write the condition, the NAR conversion, in this case, would be: \"\"\"condition (x is true)\"\"\"\n- Similarly, if you want to check if 'x' is false, you can use the 'is' keyword in NAR to write the condition, the NAR conversion, in this case, would be: \"\"\"condition (x is false)\"\"\"\n\nYou can also compare with functions, for instance:\n\n- If you want to check if the natural logarithm of 'x' is equal to one, then you can simply write \"\"\"condition (ln(x) == 1)\"\"\"\n- If you want to check if the cosine of 'x+y' is greater than the cosine of 'y+z', then you can simply write \"\"\"condition (cos(x+y) > cos(y+z))\"\"\"\n\nIn the NAR, you can also make condition conjunction, disjunction, or negation, for instance:\n\n- If you NEED to check if 'x' is odd and 'y' is even, then you can do a conjunction by using the 'and' keyword. In NAR syntax: \"\"\"condition ((x % 2 != 0) and (y % 2 == 0))\"\"\"\n- If you NEED to check if 'x + y' is greater than 1 or 'z + y' is greater than 1, then you can do a disjunction by using the 'or' keyword. In NAR syntax: \"\"\"condition ((x + y > 1) or (z + y > 1))\"\"\"\n- If you NEED to check that 'x' MUST not be greater than 'y', then it is equivalent to say that for 'x' to pass the condition, it needs to be less than or equal to 'y', which is the negation of the condition. To negate a condition you can use the '!' keyword. In NAR syntax: \"\"\"condition !(x > y)\"\"\", the equivalent non-negated condition would be \"\"\"condition (x <= y)\"\"\"\n- Be aware of negating a condition inside a conjunction or disjunction, because if you negate the conjunction or disjunction, then the negation is applied over all the conditions. For instance:\n\"\"\"condition (!(x > y) and (x > z))\"\"\" is not the same as \"\"\"condition !((x > y) and (x > z))\"\"\" because the first means that 'x' MUST not be greater than 'y' but 'x' MUST be greater than 'z'. However, the second condition means that 'x' MUST be less than or equal to 'y' or MUST be less than or equal to 'z', which is totally different from the first condition.\n\nThe following map shows a what the equivalent negation is for different operators in NAR:\n\n- The negation of '>=' is '<'\n- The negation of '>' is '<='\n- The negation of '<=' is '>'\n- The negation of '<' is '>='\n- The negation of '==' is '!='\n- The negation of '!=' is '=='\n- The negation of 'and' is 'or'\n- The negation of 'or' is 'and'\n\nTo write an action, you MUST ensure that the 'action' section is also declared, and to do so you just have to write 'action:' then you start writing the actions in NAR's syntax, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\naction:\n    x = y + 1 condition (y > x)\n    y = x condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nThe following examples comprehensively explain how to handle multiple type of actions.\n\n1) Consider an example in which you have to set a pointer variable 'x' to 'y + 1' such that 'y' is a pointer variable too. In NAR, pointer variables are handled as an ordinary variable. Therefore, there are no dereferencing or arrow operators to manipulate them. A tip to understand this, is to use them like integers or reals. Since the condition is not stated the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = y + 1 condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n2) Set 'z' to 'x + y' only if x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 2. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x + y condition (x == 1) and (y == 2)\n\"\"\"\n\n4) Set 'x' to 'y' in any case or whatever the case. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n3) The Nectron Abstract Representation doesn't allow any form of iteration mechanisms, therefore do not use loops. \n4) Set 'x' to '((z + y) / 2) * z * y'. Since, the condition is not stated, and it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = ((z + y) / 2) * z * y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n10) Let's consider another example for an action in which you have to set 'x' to 'y * (y + 1) * (y + 2) * (y + 3)' in any case or whatever the case. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = y * (y + 1) * (y + 2) * (y + 3) condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n5) Set 'z' to 'x / y'. In this case, if the condition is not specified explicitly, you NEED to focus the condition on the denominator because division over 0 is not allowed mathematically. Therefore, you should perform the action only if 'y' is not equal to 0. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x / y condition (y != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n6) Set 'x' to 'y / (z * t)'. In this case, if the condition is not specified explicitly, you NEED to condition performing this action on the values of 'z' and 't'. Since division by 0 is not allowed in mathematics, you NEED to check if 'z' and 't' are equal to zero, meaning you can only perform the action if both 'z' and 't' are not equal to zero. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = y / (z * t) condition (z != 0) and (t != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n7) Set 'x' to 'y / (z + t)'. In this case, if the condition is not specified explicitly, you NEED to condition performing this action on the values of 'z' or 't'. Since division by 0 is not allowed in mathematics, you NEED to check if 'z' or 't' are equal to zero, meaning you can only perform the action if one of 'z' or 't' is not equal to zero. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx = y / (z + t) condition (z != 0) or (t != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n8) Perform a bitwise 'AND' operation between two variables 'x' and 'y' and assign the result in another variable 'z'. Since, the condition is not stated, and it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x & y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n9) Perform a bitwise 'OR' operation between two variables 'x' and 'y' and assign the result to another variable 'z'. Since the condition is not stated, it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x | y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n10) Perform a bitwise 'XOR' operation between two variables 'x' and 'y' and assign the result to another variable 'z'. Since the condition is not stated, it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x ^ y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n11) Perform a bitwise 'RIGHT SHIFT' operation between two variables 'x' and 'y' and assign the result to another variable 'z'. Since the condition is not stated, it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x >> y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n12) Perform a bitwise 'LEFT SHIFT' operation between two variables 'x' and 'y' and assign the result in another variable 'z'. Since the condition is not stated, it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = x << y condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n13) Perform a bitwise 'NOT' operation on a variable 'x' and assign the result to another variable 'y'. Since the condition is not stated, it's not necessary. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nz = ~x condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nIn the example above, we have performed two actions. In the first action, we have set 'x' to 'y+1' when 'y' is strictly greater than 'x'. Whereas, in the second action, we have set 'y' to 'x' under no condition at all, which is why we used the keyword 'ANY'.\n\n- Note that each action is written in a new line.\n- Each action MUST have a condition.\n\n\nFinally, each NAR translation has one 'return' section, which is where all the outputs of the sequential reasoning strategy are returned under a certain condition. A return is expressed as follows:\n\n<output> condition <condition | ANY>\n\n- The <output> encapsulates an output of sequential reasoning strategy which could be a variable, mathematical expression, boolean (true, false), function, bitwise operation, the 'None' keyword in case there's no return, or the 'POS' or 'NEG' keywords in case there's a broader range of positive, or negative values, respectively.\n- The keyword 'condition' signifies that this particular assignment is performed under a certain condition.\n- The <condition | ANY> is where the condition holds place, it indicates that this assignment should pass this condition for it to be performed. If the condition is explicitly stated or your reasoning capabilities have determined one, write it between parentheses. However, if the assignment is performed in any case, then you MUST use the keyword 'ANY'. Use the examples above to have clear guidance.\n\nTo write a return, you MUST ensure that the 'return' section is also declared, and to do so you just have to write 'return:' then you start writing the actions in NAR's syntax, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\nreturn:\n    x condition (x % 2 == 0)\n    abs(x) condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nThe following examples comprehensively explain how to handle multiple type of returns.\n\n1) Return 'None' if 'x + y' is not divisible by 3. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nNone condition ((x + y) % 3 != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n2) Return 'None' whatever the case, meaning that the sequential reasoning strategy doesn't return anything. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nNone condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n3) Return 'None' in case ln(x) equals to zero and ln(y) is equal to one. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nNone condition ((ln(x) == 0) and (ln(y) == 1))\n\"\"\"\n\n4) Return the expression '-(x + 1 - z * (y/x))'. In this the condition is not stated; however, your priority condition should be that 'x' (denominator) MUST not equal zero. Therefore, the conversion of this return statement in the Nectron Abstract Representation would be:\n\n\"\"\"\n-(x + 1 - z * (y/x)) condition (x != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n5) NAR also allows bitwise operations as expressions that can be returned as an output. Consider returning the value of bitwise not 'x'. Also, you NEED to return bitwise AND between 'x' and 'y' if y is positive The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\n~x condition ANY\nx & y condition (y >= 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n6) As NAR allows the output to be a boolean too, let's consider a return in which you have to return 'true' if variable 'x' if x is not equal to 'z + 1', and another return in which you have to return 'false' if y is equal to 'x'. The NAR conversion in this case would be:\n\n\"\"\"\ntrue condition (x != z + 1)\nfalse condition (y == x)\n\"\"\"\n\n7) Be aware of the case where the sequential reasoning strategy wants to return true and false in any case, as shown below:\n\n\"\"\"\ntrue condition ANY\nfalse condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is case is not valid and incorrect semantically. Therefore, in the presence of ANY, only one boolean should be returned depending on the context.\n\n8) As the Nectron Abstract Representation allows the output to be a number too, let's consider a return in which you have to return 1 if x equals 0. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\n1 condition (x == 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n9) You have multiple number returns with conditions: return 1 if x is zero, 2 if x + 1 equals 2, and -1 if x - 1 equals -1. The NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\n1 condition (x == 0)\n2 condition (x + 1 == 2)\n-1 condition (x - 1 == -1)\n\"\"\"\n\n10) As the Nectron Abstract Representation allows the output to be a pointer too, let's consider a return in which you have to return a pointer variable 'x' if x is even. In NAR, pointer variables work just as ordinary ones, say integers because the compiler of the language handles the things that go behind them. Therefore, do not use dereferencing or arrow operators, handle them just as you would handle integers. The NAR conversion in this case would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nx condition (x%2 != 0)\n\"\"\"\n\n11) Sometimes, the value that needs to be returned has a broad range of values: positive, negative, zero, or everything in between. However, in NAR there are two useful keywords to consider: 'POS' which encapsulates an output that MUST be positive, or 'NEG' which encapsulates an output that MUST be negative.\n\nTo illustrate the usefulness of these two keywords, let's consider an example in which you have to return the absolute value of 'x'. Since the absolute value is always positive, then you can use the keyword 'POS' as an output, which indicates that the value of the output has to be positive. As such, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nPOS condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\nAnother case is if we want to return the negative of the absolute value of x i.e. (-|x|). In this case, the output necessarily has to be negative. Therefore, you can use the keyword 'NEG' as an output, which indicates that the value of the output has to be negative. As such, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n\"\"\"\nNEG condition ANY\n\"\"\"\n\n- Note that each return is written in a new line.\n- Each return MUST have a condition.\n\nTo fully understand the NAR format and how you translate it to NAR, consider the example of a sequential reasoning strategy that presents a methodology - expressed in natural language - for a program that swaps two numbers using pointers. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n<nar>\nvar:\n    x, y: pointer\naction:\n    temp = x condition ANY\n    x = y condition ANY\n    y = temp condition ANY\nreturn:\n    None condition ANY\n</nar>\n\nThe strategy doesn't return anything, that's why we have used the keyword 'None'.\n\nAnother example is a sequential reasoning strategy that presents a methodology for a program that swaps two numbers only when they are both positive. Then, the NAR conversion would be:\n\n<nar>\nvar:\n    x, y: integer\naction:\n    temp = x condition ANY\n    x = y condition (x >= 0) and (y >= 0)\n    y = temp condition (x >= 0) and (y >= 0)\nreturn:\n    None condition ANY\n</nar>\n\nThe strategy doesn't return anything, that's why we have used the keyword 'None'.\n\nThere are multiple predefined functions in NAR:\n\n- The 'cos()', is used to calculate the cosine value of a variable or expression. Only one parameter is accepted and the output is always between -1 and 1. In an action's syntax \"\"\"y = cos(x) condition ANY\"\"\", this action means that 'y' stores the cosine value of 'x' in 'y'.\n- The 'sin(), is used to calculate the sine value of a variable or expression. Only one parameter is accepted and the output is always between -1 and 1. In an action's syntax \"\"\"y = sin(x) condition ANY\"\"\", this action means that 'y' stores the sine value of 'x' in 'y'.\n- The 'tan(), is used to calculate the tangent value of a variable or expression. Only one parameter is accepted. In an action's syntax \"\"\"y = tan(x) condition ANY\"\"\", this action means that 'y' stores the tangent value of 'x' in 'y'.\n- The 'atan(), is used to calculate the arctangent value of a variable or expression. Only one parameter is accepted. In an action's syntax \"\"\"y = arctan(x) condition ANY\"\"\", this action means that 'y' stores the arctangent value of 'x' in 'y'.\n- The 'tanh(), is used to calculate the hyperbolic tangent value of a variable or expression. Only one parameter is accepted. In an action's syntax \"\"\"y = tanh(x) condition ANY\"\"\", this action means that 'y' stores the hyperbolic tangent value of 'x' in 'y'.\n- The 'power()' function, is used to calculate exponentation. So, if we want to raise 'x' to the power of 2, we can call 'power(x,2)'. Only two parameters are accepted and the output is always greater or equal to zero. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"power(x, 2) condition ANY\"\"\".\n- The 'abs()' function, is used to calculate the absolute value of a variable or an expression. Only one parameter is accepted, and the output is always greater or equal to zero. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"abs(x) condition ANY\"\"\" This return statement means that we return the absolute value of 'x'.\n- The 'ln()' function, is used to calculate the natural logarithm of a variable or an expression, under the condition that the input of this function MUST be strictly positive i.e. (x > 0). Only one parameter is accepted. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"ln(x) condition (x > 0)\"\"\" This return statement means that when x is strictly positive we return the natural logarithm of 'x'.\n- The 'log()' function, is used to calculate the logarithm base 10 of a variable or an expression, under the condition that the input of this function MUST be strictly positive i.e. (x > 0). Only one parameter is accepted. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"log(x) condition (x > 0)\"\"\" This return statement means that when 'x' is strictly positive we return the logarithm base 10 of 'x'.\n- The 'exp()' function, is used to calculate the exponential of a variable or an expression. Only one parameter is accepted and the output of this function is always positive. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"exp(x) condition ANY\"\"\" This return statement means that we return the exponential value of 'x'.\n- The 'fact()' function, is used to calculate the factorial of a variable or an expression, under a condition that the input of this function MUST be greater or equal to zero i.e. (x >= 0) Only one parameter is accepted and the output of this function is always positive. In a return statement's syntax \"\"\"fact(x-1) condition (x - 1 >= 0)\"\"\" This return statement means that the factorial value of 'x-1' is returned when 'x-1' is positive.\n\n- Do not use any function other than those specified by the framework of the Nectron Abstract Representation.\n- Each action MUST contain an assignment.\n- Each return MUST contain a condition, either specified or ANY.\n- Functions can accept mathematical expressions when appropriate, and they can be used in mathematical expressions themselves.\n- The NAR allows only the following mathematical operators: Addition '+', Subtraction '-', Multiplication '*', Division '/', Modulo '%', and Floor Division '//'.\n- The NAR allows only the following bitwise operators: NOT '~', AND '&', OR '|', XOR '^', RIGHT SHIFT '>>', LEFT SHIFT '<<'.\n- Do not use loops or recursions. However, one trick you can use to avoid this limitation, when appropriate of course, is to only consider what's happening (assignments, returns, etc..) inside the loop or recursion, especially if the loop or recursion is not complex.\n- If any form of iteration (Loops or Recursion) is necessary for the program so intrinsically that the NAR representation cannot be corrected and you cannot deduce the states of the input variables after the iteration block. Then, simply write <NON_NAR_PROGRAM>.\n- strings are NOT allowed - NO string variables or text in quotes - in NAR so use ONLY what's given.\n- If a variable name is missing or not entered, make sure to generate an appropriate name based on your reasoning on the sequential reasoning strategy as a whole.\n- If a variable type is missing or not entered, make sure to give the appropriate type based on your reasoning on the sequential reasoning strategy as a whole.\n- Pointer variables in NAR don't work like pointer variables in C or C++, they work as an ordinary variable. So when you write in NAR, do not use dereferencing (*), do not use arrow (->) operators.\n\nWith all this knowledge, please take the following sequential reasoning strategy:\n\n<srs>\nINPUT_SRS\n</srs>\n\nAnd convert it into a NAR representation to the best of your abilities:\n\n<nar>\nNAR_PROGRAM\n</nar>\n\nThe corrected NAR MUST be wrapped inside <nar> </nar>, NO other delimiter is allowed.\n\nTo ensure you follow a valid generation reasoning, it is best that you also provide an explanation for your answer. Simply write:\n\n<explanation>\nWrite the explanation here...\n</explanation>",

  "sphinx": "You're a formal methods' expert trying to revise a set of contracts for a function. There's no code for the function, but you will be having an algorithmic description for what the function does, as well as the contracts that you NEED to verify. These contracts are written in the ACSL Specification Language.\n\n(ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) is a formal specification language designed for use with C programs. It provides a way to specify the behavior and properties of C functions and programs using annotations written in comments within the source code. These annotations describe preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and other properties the program should satisfy.

The expected properties are known as the preconditions, while the guaranteed properties of the output are referred to as the postconditions.\n\nTo guide your revision process, the following is a comprehensive listing of ACSL constructs, keywords, predicates, etc. The list contain the syntactic name and the description of what it does. Leverage these descriptions and your reasoning capabilities to ensure you revise the given contracts in the most complete and correct way possible.\n\n\"\"\"\nrequires : The requires predicate is used to specify the precondition.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires a > 0;\n        ensures \\result > 1;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The function requires \"a\" to be strictly positive\n\n    - requires and ensures together form the building block for specifying function contracts.\n    - If there is no requires predicate specified, it implies /*@ requires true; */ i.e. precondition remains satisfied always.\n    - There can be one or more instances requires predicate for a function.\n\nensures : The ensures predicate is used to specify the postcondition.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ ensures \\result > a; */\n\n    Explanation: We expect the return of the function to be always to be strictly greater than \"a\".\n\n    - The ensures keyword is followed by a logical condition that be to true/false followed by semi-colon.\n    - There can be more than one ensures instance for a function specified in multiple lines.\n    - Equivalently you can also concatenate them within a single ensures predicate instance by using logical operators &&, ||, ! operators.\n\nassigns : The assigns clause is used to specify which global variable(s) can be modified by the function. It is part of function contract.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ assigns g; */\n\n   Explanation: The function modifies the variable g.\n\n   - In the absence of assigns clause in a function contract, the function is free to modify any visible global variable.\n   - /*@ assigns \\nothing */ disallows modification of any global variable. This clause can be used as a means to avoid/minimize side-effects.\n   - /*@ assigns g */ allows only the variable g to be modified. Other global variables cannot be modified.\n\nbehavior : A function can exhibit more than one behavior. Verification MUST hence be different depending on the particular behavior. The \"behavior\" keyword is used to specify each behavior.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ behavior positive_a:\n            assumes a > 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+1;\n    */\n\n   Explanation: The behavior positive_a states that only if \"a\" is positive, the return value MUST be checked for the specified condition.\n\nassumes : the \"assumes\" keyword serves as the trigger for checking each behavior.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ behavior positive_a:\n            assumes a > 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+1;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The positive_a assumes that \"a\" is strictly positive.\n\ncomplete behaviors : Multiple behaviors can be stated to cover all possibilities to make the specification complete.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ behavior positive a:\n            assumes a > 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+1;\n        behavior negative a:\n            assumes a <= 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+2;\n        complete behaviors positive_a, negative_a;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The behaviors positive_a and negative_a are stated to be complete. So appropriate behavior check is triggered based on the assumes predicate.\n\ndisjoint behaviors : The behaviors can be stated as disjoint so that one possibility does not result in triggering of two behaviors.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ behavior positive a:\n            assumes a > 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+1;\n        behavior negative a:\n            assumes a <= 0;\n            ensures \\result > a+2;\n        complete behaviors positive_a, negative_a;\n        disjoint behaviors positive_a, negative_a;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The behaviors positive_a and negative_a are stated to be complete and disjoint. So appropriate behavior check is triggered based on the assumes predicate.\n\n\\result : This is a generic way to refer to the return value of a function.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires a > 0;\n        ensures \\result > 1;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: We expect the return of the function to be strictly greater than 1.\n\n\\valid() : The built-in function \\valid is used to specify that the given argument points to a valid address. i.e. it can be de-referenced.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires \\valid(ptr);\n        ensures \\result == *ptr + 1;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: Though the increment logic is correct, if ptr happens to be a null pointer, it will only result in memory (segmentation) fault. \\valid here states that increment contractually agrees to work correctly provided the argument ptr points to a valid memory location. It is required while working with arrays also since array boundaries cannot be exceeded. We will see the arrays later.\n\n\\valid_read() : \\valid_read indicates that a pointer can be dereferenced, but only to read the pointed memory.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires \\valid(ptr);\n        ensures \\result == *ptr + 1;\n    */\n\n    /*@ requires \\valid(a) && \\valid_read(b);\n        requires \\separated(a, b);\n        assigns *a;\n        ensures *a == \\old(*a)+ *b;\n        ensures *b == \\old(*b);\n    */\n\n    Explanation: A write access would result in an undefined behavior. In such a case, we can specify that the pointer p MUST be \\valid_read and not \\valid.\n\n\\old() : The built-in function \\old is used to access the previous state of a variable.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ ensures a == \\old(a) + 1; */\n\n    Explanation: The postcondition suggests that the new value of \"a\" MUST take the old value of \"a\" + 1.\n\n    - The \\old function evaluates its argument in the pre-state. i.e. as per the state before the function begins.\n\n\\separated() : \\separated(p1, ...,pn) receives in parameter a set of pointers and is true if and only if these pointers are non-overlapping.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires \\valid(a) && \\valid_read(b);\n        requires \\separated(a, b);\n        assigns *a;\n        ensures *a == \\old(*a)+ *b;\n        ensures *b == \\old(*b);\n    */\n\n    Explanation: Here \\separated(a, b) evaluates to true only if and only if the pointers \"a\" and \"b\" don't overlap, which consequently don't allow assignments to be performed on the same address in case the pointers overlap.\n\n\\forall : a universal logic quantifiers that allows to state that for any element, some property is true.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ \\forall size_t off ; 0 <= off < length ==> a[off] != element; */\n\n    Explanation: With \\forall type a ; p(a) ==> q(a) , the constraint p is followed by an implication. For any element where a first property p is verified, we have to also verify the second property q.\n\n\\exists : a universal logic quantifiers that allows to say that there exists some element such that the property is true.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ \\exists size_t off ; 0 <= off < length && a[off] == element; */\n\n    Explanation: With \\exists type a ; p(a) && q(a) , the constraint p is followed by a conjunction. We say there exists an element such that it satisfies the property p at the same time it also satisfies q.\n\n\\nothing : we sometimes want to specify that a function is side effect free. We specify this by giving \\nothing to assigns.\n\n> For example:\n    /*@ requires \\valid_read(a);\n        requires *a <= INT_MAX - 5;\n        assigns \\nothing;\n        ensures \\result == *a + 5;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The function assigns nothing in its scope. As such, it is side effect free.\n\n\\true : This is a good property, meaning that no specific hypothesis is taken in input.\n\n> For example:\n    /*@ requires \\true;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The function is not restricted by no hypothesis.\n\n    - /*@ requires \\true; */ has no restriction on its precondition.\n    - /*@ ensures \\true; */ there is no risk associated with such a contract, we gain no information after calling the function, which can be a problem when the function has side effects.\n\n\\false : Producing a correct specification is crucial. Typically, by stating a false precondition, we can have the possibility to create a proof of false.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ requires a < 0 && a > 0;\n        ensures \\false;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The function takes in an argument \"a\", but it does nothing. As such, we stated in ACSL that we require \"a\" to be positive and negative at same time which is not logical. Then, we've specified that the function returns nothing by ensuring \\false.\n\n    - /*@ requires \\false; */ is too restrictive. The function can never be called from any context.\n    - /*@ ensures \\false; */ is the most dangerous extreme specification that we may encounter. If this function has a body and the specification is provable, it means that it never terminates normally: it always exits abnormally or loops infinitely. If the function has no body, the postcondition is assumed.\n\npredicate : one important use of predicates (and logic functions) is to make our specifications more readable and to factor it.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ predicate valid_range_r(int* t, integer beg, integer end) = end >= beg && \\valid_read(t + (beg .. end-1));\n        predicate valid_range_r(int* t, integer n) = valid_range_r(t, 0, n) ;\n        requires 0 < length;\n        requires valid_range_r(array, length);\n    */\n\n    Explanation: valid_range_r is a predicate that expresses the validity of an array in reading or writing. It allows us to avoid writing the complete expression every time we need it and to make it readable quickly.\n\naxiomatic : Axioms are properties we state to be true no matter the situation. It is a good way to state complex properties that will allow the proof process to be more efficient by abstracting their complexity. Of course, as any property expressed as an axiom is assumed to be true, we have to be very careful when we use them to defined properties: if we introduce a false property in our assumptions, “false” becomes “true” and we can then prove anything.\n\n-> Syntax:\n    /*@ axiomatic Name_of_the_axiomatic_definition {\n             // here we can define or declare functions and predicates\n             axiom axiom_name { Label0, ..., LabelN }:\n             // property;\n             axiom other_axiom_name { Label0, ..., LabelM }:\n             // property;\n             // ... we can put as many axioms we need\n        }\n    */\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ axiomatic lt_plus_lt{\n            axiom always_true_lt_plus_lt:\n            \\forall integer i, j; i < j ==> i+1 < j+1;\n        }\n    */\n\n    Explanation: This property is actually assumed to be true.\n\nlogic : Logic functions are meant to describe functions that can only be used in specifications. It allows us, first, to factor those specifications and, second, to define some operations on integer or real with the guarantee that they cannot overflow since they involve mathematical types. Like predicates, they can receive different labels and values in parameter.\n\n-> Syntax:\n    /*@ logic return_type my_function{ Label0, ..., LabelN }( type0 arg0, ..., typeN argN ) = formula using the arguments\n    */\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ logic integer ax_b(integer a, integer x, integer b) = a * x + b;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: A definition of a mathematical linear function using a logic function \"ax_b\". Which can be used to prove a function.\n\n    /*@ assigns \\nothing;\n        ensures \\result == ax_b(3,x,4);\n    */\n\nreads : A small subtlety that we MUST take care of is the fact that if some axioms state properties about the content of some pointed memory cells, we have to specify considered memory blocks using the reads notation in the declaration. If we omit such a specification, the predicate or function will be considered to be stated about the received pointers and not about pointer memory blocks. So, if the code modifies the content of an array for which we had proven that the predicate or function gives some result, this result will not be considered to be potentially different.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ axiomatic A_all_zeros{\n            predicate zeroed{L}(int* a, integer b, integer e) reads a[b .. e-1];\n            axiom zeroed_empty{L}:\n            \\forall int* a, integer b, e; b >= e ==> zeroed{L}(a,b,e);\n            axiom zeroed_range{L}:\n            \\forall int* a, integer b, e; b < e ==>\n            zeroed{L}(a,b,e-1) && a[e-1] == 0 ==> zeroed{L}(a,b,e);\n        }\n    */\n\n    Explanation: Notice the reads[b .. e-1] that specifies the memory location on which the predicate depends. While it is not necessary to specify what are the memory locations read in an inductive definition, we have to specify such an information for axiomatically defined properties.\n\nlemma : Lemmas are general properties about predicates or functions. These properties can be proved in isolation of the rest of the proof of a program by automatic or (more often) interactive provers.\n\n-> Syntax:\n    /*@ lemma name_of_the_lemma { Label0, ..., LabelN }: property;\n    */\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@ lemma name_of_the_lemma { Label0, ..., LabelN }: property;\n        lemma lt_plus_lt: \\forall integer i, j ; i < j ==> i+1 < j+1;\n    */\n\n    Explanation: The properties we want to express do not depend on received parameters (except for labels). So we express these properties for universally quantified variables. For example, we can state this lemma, which is true, even if it is trivial.\n\ndecreases : is a kind of variant to bound the number of recursive calls.\n\n-> For example:\n     /*@\n        decreases n;\n     */\n\n     Explanation: The expression considered by a decreases clause is a positive expression that strictly decreases when the function is called again.\n\n\\initialized() : Sometimes, while reading a memory location is authorized, the value might not be usable because it has not been initialized previously. Depending on the situation, it might cause undefined or unspecified behavior. While the last is not as bad as the former, it is generally not an intended behavior, thus ACSL does not distinguish these cases. One can specify that a memory location is initialized using the.\\initialized predicate.\n\n-> For example:\n    /*@\n        requires \\valid (p) && \\valid(q);\n        requires \\initialized(p) && \\initialized(q);\n        assigns *p, *q;\n        ensures *p == \\old (*q) && *q == \\old (*p);\n    */\n\n    Explanation: Pointer variables \"p\" and \"q\" MUST be initialized in order to be used.\n\ninductive : Inductive predicates gives a way to state properties whose verification requires to reason by induction, that is to say: for a property p(input), it is true for some base cases (for example, 0 is an even natural number), and knowing that p(input) is true, it is also true for a bigger input, provided that some conditions relating input and bigger input are verified (for example, knowing that n is even, we define that n+2 is also even). Thus, inductive predicates are generally useful to define properties recursively.\n\n-> Syntax:\n    /*@ inductive property{ Label0, ..., LabelN }(type0 a0, ..., typeN aN) {\n            case c_1{Lq_0, ..., Lq_X}: p_1;\n            case c_m{Lr_0, ..., Lr_Y}: p_km;\n        }\n    */\n\n    - Where all c_i are names and all p_i are logic formulas where property appears has a conclusion. Basically, property is true for some parameters and some labels, if it corresponds to one of the cases of the inductive definition.\n\n-> For example:\n     /*@\n        inductive even_natural{L}(integer n) {\n        case even_nul{L}:\n        even_natural(0);\n        case even_not_nul_natural{L}:\n        \\forall integer n; even_natural(n) ==> even_natural(n+2);\n        }\n     */\n\n     Explanation: Definition of a natural number is even using induction. We can translate the sentence: “0 is an even natural number, and if n is an even natural number, n + 2 is an even natural number”.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIf there are overflows in the function, the post-conditions will not hold. In order to overcome this issue, a possible solution is to add some assertions before each int operation ensuring that there is no overflow. In the ACSL annotations, the arithmetic operations +,-,... are the mathematical addition, substraction,... in the integer domain. It is therefore possible to compare their results to INT_MAX or INT_MIN (#include <limits.h> - JUST ONCE - if you do so). The given specification might have overflow checks, refine them if they are not correctly written.\n\nThe verification plan of the function is the following:\n\n<verification_plan>\n%VPLAN%\n</verification_plan>\n\nWhich corresponds to the following description:\n\n\"\"\"\nPROGRAM_DESCRIPTION\n\"\"\"\n\nThe contracts you NEED to revise are the following:\n\n<contracts>\nINPUT_CONTRACTS\n</contracts>\n\nWrite the revised ACSL contracts using the following template:\n\n<acsl_revised>\nWrite the revised contracts here...\n</acsl_revised>\n\nHere are some rules you MUST respect:\n\n- Don't write or include any C code implementation, write only the ACSL contracts.\n- Be extremely cautious about the logical consistency of your revisions. Therefore, don't hallucinate with some keywords other than the given ones and make sure you employ your reasoning to map out the side effects of using a keyword before writing it down.\n- Make sure to not overcomplicate things if not necessary, KEEP it simple and clear.\n\nThe revised ACSL contracts MUST be wrapped inside <acsl_revised> </acsl_revised>, NO other delimiter is allowed.\n- To ensure you follow a valid revision process, it is best that you also provide an explanation for your corrections.
